# PyConvection

`PyConvection` is a Python library designed for calculating convection coefficients for natural and forced convectionâ€”using analytical and empirical correlations. 
It provides a convenient interface for engineers and researchers who want to evaluate heat transfer performance for various geometries without resorting to full CFD simulations.

## Features
- `Natural Convection`: Compute convection coefficients using correlations based on the Rayleigh number and other dimensionless parameters.
- `Forced Convection`: Evaluate convection coefficients under forced flow conditions.
